# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Feature Tasks
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue.
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
The class should contain the following methods:
* push, pop, peek, is empty

reate a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
The class should contain the following methods:
* enqueue, dequeue, peek, is empty


## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Created a Node class which takes the value of the node and the next node.
Created Stack class that takes the top node with a default value of None.
Created a Queue class that takes front and rear nodes with a default value of None.
Using Test-driven development implemented all the above methods one by one until all test passed.

Big O
time: O(1) all methods have time complexity of O(1) regardless of the number of nodes.
space: O(1) all methods have space complexity of O(1)
