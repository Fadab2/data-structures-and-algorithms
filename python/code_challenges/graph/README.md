# Graphs
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
* add_node
* add edge
* get node
* get neighbors
* size

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Implemented a Graph class to with the above methods.
Implemented a Vertex class to initialize a vertex and return string representation of the vertex
Implemented an Edge class to initialize an edge with vertex and a weight.

Efficiency: efficiency ranges from O(1) to O(N) depending on the specific method whether requires search or not.
