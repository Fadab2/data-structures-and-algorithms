# Graph Breadth First
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
![whiteboard](./breadth-first-graph.png)

Input: a node
Output: a collection of nodes
