# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
buzz tree.  Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”

If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”

If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”

If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Big O
time: O(n) as we only traverse the tree once.
space: O(n) as we have to create a new tree with the number of nodes in that tree.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
